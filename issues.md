Description
Ever get frustrated with using a website because something isn't working towards your expectations? Quite often in a project product defects or feedback will arise that you will want to provide to the development team. Developers appreciate your feedback, because they want to make sure the product works correctly. However, it's increasingly difficult for a developer to understand what you are doing as a user and how you interact with the system, without you properly describing your issue. The better you can adhere to the format the quicker developers can fix your issue. The following is how to properly 

Step 1 
Go to: https://aboutmybrowser.com and copy and paste a link to your browser details. 

Example - https://aboutmybrowser.com/rAuFhmwk

Step 2
Provide a description for the defect

1. What are the steps and inputs that the user completed?
2. What result did the user get?
3. (Defect) What they expect to happen? (Feedback) What would you like to happen that didn't happen?

Step 3
Try to categorize the issue as a Defect or Feedback. The difference between the two is often debated on the web. However the fundamental difference between the two is answering question 3 as part of Step 2. 
 
Step 4
Provide any screenshots. We use Skitch, http://evernote.com/skitch/ because it's fast and easy to screenshot and annotate what you're seeing. Even better, if you record your desktop with Screenr http://www.screenr.com/ then this really helps. The more information the quicker your issue gets resolved. 

Example of an defect:
Here are my browser details: https://aboutmybrowser.com/rAuFhmwk
1. I went to http://ignitelab.net/ and I clicked the big "CONTACT" button up top. I entered my email address (mike@example.com) and I typed in "I'm looking for a website, can you help me!?". I then clicked "Send your Message"
2. I got an error message that said "Invalid email". I tried putting in mike@example.com again and clicked "Send your Message". I received the same error message. 
3. I expected the system to send Ignite Lab an email so they could contact me.

Here is a screenshot of what I'm seeing:

Example of feedback
Here are my browser details: https://aboutmybrowser.com/rAuFhmwk
1. I went to http://ignitelab.net/ and I clicked the big "CONTACT" button up top. I entered my email address (mike@example.com) and I typed in "I'm looking for a website, can you help me!?". I then clicked "Send your Message"
2. The pop-up disappeared, but then nothing else happened.
3. I expected that I would get an automatic e-mail from Ignite Lab saying someone would be in contact with me. I'm confused if the system actually logged my request.
