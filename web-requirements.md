# Web Design Process

Wireframes -> Document Flow -> Static HTML/CSS 

1. We wireframe using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) and comments are made on them in our [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com/) app
2. We document the flow of information and interaciton using [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle) (and upload to Marvel for review)
3. Then we turn wireframes into pure HTML/CSS using a simple static [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) app. 

## Rapid Prototyping 

Rapidly prototyping the system is extremely important to the success of any project. In 99% of the projects that fail to meet clients expectations, it's because the requirements are not clear. Providing clear requirements is a very difficult thing to do because most clients can't properly articulate what they want, our team has a difficult time understanding what exactly should be built and what the client wants might be very different from what their user wants. 

For this, we like to create non-dynamic prototypes that allow us to change things very quickly. We also invest in various technology tools that decrease the time to deliver.
