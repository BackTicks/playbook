# Agile Software Development

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29
The Agile movement proposes alternatives to traditional project management. Agile approaches are typically used in software development to help businesses respond to unpredictability. There is a great overlap between Rails, the main technology we use to build web apps, and agile. Ruby on Rails apps allow for a very fast way to market and are an excellent prototyping tool. Next to prototyping, they also have proven to be reliable and scalable.

## Scrum

With BackTicks, we follow an agile way of development called Scrum. It is a framework for incremental product development that consists of self-organizing team. Since we keep our team delibirately small, it allows is to move fast and work in lean product increments. Scrum’s incremental, iterative approach trades the traditional phases of “waterfall” development for the ability to develop a subset of high-value features first, incorporating feedback sooner.

In a Scrum way of working, we have three roles:
- Product Owner
- Dev team
- Scrum Master

Next to the following roles, we have five different meetings. We deliberately try to keep these meetings short.

- Backlog
- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospection

In the next section, we will look at what these meetings mean and how they can help the general approach to building reliable web and mobile applications. 

## Sprints

In Scrum, work is confined to a regular, repeatable work cycle, known as a sprint or iteration. Usually, a sprint is two weeks long, but ultimately, this is a team decision. One must weigh the advantages or disadvantages of a longer or shorter sprint for their specific development needs.
