# Measuring

When we make significant changes to our apps, we do them in a quantifiable way instead of guessing or relying solely on intuition. In other words we use a data-driven mentality to make decisions. In order to do so, we must have good data. Capturing data in apps is done by the following process:

1. Create tags on key events 
2. Send those 
3. Depending on the application at hand we send that to various services including:
  1. Google Analytics - for aggregated views of data
  2. MixPanel - for A/B testing, funnel analysis, and user action insight 
  3. Intercom - for user/business centric apps that allow us to collect intelligence and do drip marketing

Depending on the goals of the app ("goal oriented"), we will mix and match these services as we need to.
