MP Playbook
========

Sections of the playbook will be developed ad hoc. The basic premise of the MP Playbook is the following:

* Make it readable by a prospective client in < 15 minutes
* Articulate our overall software design process 

Our motivation for creating this is the following:

* Many questions we get from perspective clients are repetitive. 
* Continuous improvement 
* Set expectations
