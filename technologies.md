# What car to drive

When designing software applications we have to first decide, what category does your app reside in. This is not dissimiliar to choosing a car. Do you need a sedan, SUV, truck, sportscar, etc? In the web world we break these down into three distinct categories:

1. Web Application - Ruby on Rails 
2. Mobile App - iOS
3. Rich Web Application - Ember.js

Which technology category we choose is heavily dependant on the nature of your app. The following questions must be asked:

1. Is experience on a mobile device important for the success of your app?
2. Does your app rely on people searching for specific pages via search engines?
3. Does a majority of app activity sit behind a user login with sensitive data? 

# Under the hood

We utilize a subset of technologies that help us deliver functionality. We typically utilize and have experience in the following:

1. Database - Postgres, MongoDB
2. Search - ElasticSearch
3. 

# Oursourcing

Often in app development it makes sense to let other companies provide solutions to problems that are hard technically to manage, but easy for us to integrate. 

1. Hosting - Heroku for web, Parse for mobile
2. Web Services - Amazon Web Services (typicall S3, Route53, and SES)
3. Database-as-a-Service - Firebase
4. E-mail marketing - Mailchimp
