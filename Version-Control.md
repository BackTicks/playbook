## Version Control

Version control allows us to manage changes to our code base. At any point in time, we can access several versions of our projects, and show changes made over time. This is especially useful when working with teams that are responsible for different feature sets. More advanced features like branching and merging let us have multiple parallel lines of development. We work on multiple simultaneous features without any interference.

For all of our projects, we use git as a version control system. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005, and has since become the most widely adopted version control system for software development.

We use [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) for hosting our git repositories.
