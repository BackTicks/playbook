#Version control

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Why is this concept so important to software development? Simple answer, change happens frequently. Imagine you could document all of the steps it takes for a house to be built, so that when an issue arises you could just look back at the history of the development. That's what version control does for software. What's even better abouts software is that we can revert back to those changes very quickly.

For a Version Control System (VCS) we use [Git](http://git-scm.com/). Git is used systmatically across arguably the largest reposotiry of the world's code at [GitHub](http://git-scm.com/) and was developed by the creator of the Linux operating system Linus Torvalds (among others). Git gives us enough control to manage software, isn't opiniated about how we do things, and still offers a lot of flexibility. 

#How do we manage technical change in our system?

Specifically for code we follow the well understood [git branching flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). 

##Why is this so important to the successful delivery to a software project?
