# Mobile Design Process

Wireframe -> Graphics -> Interactive Workflow

1. Using sketches and [Marvelapp](http://marvelapp.com)
2. We use Sketch to create vector graphics for the design from those wireframes
3. Then we use [Pixate](http://www.pixate.com/)

Using Pixate, we do user interviews to draw conclusions about the current designs' effectiveness and make changes as necessary. It's important to understand that most users will be never be able to explicitly tell you whats wrong with your design and how to improve. Rather these user interviews involve us asking a lot of questions and do a lot of listening. We get the users to talk out loud about (1) what they are thinking about (2) what they are trying to achieve. 

## Goal Oriented Design

When conducting designs, it's important to understand that design is simply a medium through which the party who created the system (us) and the party who is using the system (user) are able to reach goals. The definition of good design is when both goals teeter on a scale equally.
